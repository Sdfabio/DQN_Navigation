The banana environment has a state space of 37 and an action space of 4. So out network has an inputsize of 37 and an output size of 4. The accompanying Report.pdf has details on the network architecture.\n",

It interacts with the environment by taking actions based on a policy, collects rewards and the observation feedback, then stores the experience in the replay buffer and also initiates a learning step on the Q Network. The accompanying Report.pdf has more details on the agent."
